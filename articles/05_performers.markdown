## Birgitte Lyregaard ##

Already in primary school she captivated her friends with imitations of Edith
Piaf , Louis Armstrong, Marguerite Viby a.o. She was busy w. choir, barbershop,
funk band and theatre all through the school - and high school years.

At the age of 20 she formed her first jazz trio and at 24 she moved to Holland,
where through six years she studied jazz singing and improvisation at the
Conservatories of the Hague and Rotterdam.
