A magical concert tale for grown-ups and children. About the blind prince and
his quest for the mysterious, forbidden flower. 4 musicians and one
singer/storyteller invites the audience to come away into a world of sound and
poetry, where anything can happen...

"This ability to take the audience and keep them captured throughout the whole
performance, to be yourself on stage and tell this great story with so much
fire and intensity that we surrender completely is something that every
performer wants to have and cannot learn in schools..."

- A performance mixing story telling, music, song and improvisation.
- A surprising universe of sounds of stone, wood, water, grass.
- A story that holds the power to transform.
